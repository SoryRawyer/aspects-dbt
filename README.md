OARS dbt
########

Purpose
*******

This repository hosts the dbt project for Open edX `OARS`_. It contains sql files
and configuration that control the `ClickHouse`_ reporting schema, data 
transformations, tests, and documentation that drive OARS reports. This project 
is still in its infancy and will be growing with documentation and examples as we 
approach the OARS v1 launch.
